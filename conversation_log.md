**User:** I want to expand the section on empathy so it ties more clearly to LGBT safety.

**Assistant:** Interpreted as adding content to module `omni-0200-plurality-empathy` and linking to an LGBT safety module. Created a plan: (1) draft new paragraph about empathy and LGBT safety, (2) create or update a claim with supporting evidence, (3) run checks and open a PR.

**Actions:** Created module `omni-0300-lgbt-safety.md` and claim `claim-0043`. Updated `omni-0200-plurality-empathy` to depend on `omni-0300-lgbt-safety`. Ran checks, opened PR #5.

**Next Steps:** Gather peer-reviewed sources to support claim-0043.
