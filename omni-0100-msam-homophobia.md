## Idea

This module explores the hypothesis that some forms of homophobia are driven by a misdirection of men's fear of sexual assault. When heterosexual men experience anxieties about sexual violence—particularly the threat posed by other men—those fears can be displaced onto gay men and LGBT communities. This misdirected fear (MSAM) frames homosexuality as a threat, bolstering stereotypes and justifying discriminatory behavior.

## Why it matters

Understanding homophobia as misdirected fear reframes LGBT rights debates. It suggests that combating homophobia requires addressing underlying issues such as male aggression, societal norms around masculinity, and trauma from sexual violence. By recognizing the root causes, interventions can focus on healing rather than punishment and open pathways for solidarity across genders and orientations.
