# Style Guide

This repository aims for a consistent voice and tone across all modules and manuscripts. Follow these guidelines:

- **Voice:** Clear, conversational, and inclusive. Write in first person plural ("we") where appropriate to build solidarity.
- **Tone:** Insightful and encouraging, with gentle humor. Avoid jargon; when technical terms are necessary, explain them.
- **Perspective:** Non‑binary and plural‑friendly, sensitive to marginalized experiences.
- **Length:** Modules should be concise (1–3 pages). Break longer ideas into smaller modules and link them via dependencies.
- **Bullets and lists:** Use Markdown lists sparingly and keep points short.
- **Citations:** Use in‑line references in parentheses (e.g., [1]) and list sources in claims files or in `sources/bibliography.bib`.

These guidelines apply to modules, claims, ADRs, and the compiled book.
