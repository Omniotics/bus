# ADR 0001: MSM vs MSAM Distinction

Date: 2025-08-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In early drafts, the terms "Men's Sexual Assault Misfear" (MSM) and "Men's Sexual Assault Misdirection" (MSAM) were used interchangeably. After discussion, we realized they capture distinct phenomena.

## Decision

- **MSM (Misfear):** Fear of sameâ€‘sex attraction manifesting as homophobia.
- **MSAM (Misdirection):** Misdirected sexual assault phobia projected onto LGBT people.

We will adopt the MSM/MSAM distinction consistently in modules and claims.

## Consequences

- Modules and claims referencing misdirected homophobia will specify whether they refer to MSM or MSAM.
- Search and reader paths will differentiate these topics.
